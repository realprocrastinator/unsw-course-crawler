# unsw-course-crawler
A simple crawler for crawling courses provided by UNSW, currently for PGRD courses only.
The output will be written in *markdown* format
To use it you can run command `python3 ./courses <2020> <school> [campus]`. The argument `campus` is set to `KENS` at the moment since most of my friends are study in Sydney :)
